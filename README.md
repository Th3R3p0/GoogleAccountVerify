# GoogleAccountVerify

This python script enumerates users accounts on Google Apps. 
The user must have an emails.txt file with all of the emails to be enumerated seperated by new lines.
The user must also have a blank emailsfinal.txt file created which the valid email addresses will be appeneded to.

To do: 
Change urllib to requests (http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) (recommendation by awhitehatter)
Change hard coded files to pass by command line parameters
Allow a new file to be created if it does not exist
Allow a single e-maill address to be passed as a command line argument
